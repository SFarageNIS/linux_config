# Linux settings

Here you'll find my general customizations, tweaks and idealy dotfiles for easy import/accessibility across my devices and implementations.

Some of the dotfile settings require other downloads/setup ([plugin system](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim#quick-start), [plugins](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree#installation), [colorscheme](https://github.com/tomasiser/vim-code-dark#installation) and more)

This is primarily for my reference as I grow in comfortability with the Linux world in general.  Many things will be security-focused.

## Ubuntu/Kbuntu-specific
My latest personal environment is vanilla Ubunutu (without 3rd party, extras) on a custom built AMD 5900x with MSI RX 6800  
My current work environment is [kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/) on a Dell Precision 5520.

## Kali-specific
I have a 'pentesting' VM with Kali installed for started.  May eventually migrate to base vanilla Ubuntu with custom tooling installed as I get better at things, but until then, this will be the setup.
