# Linux settings

Here you'll find my general customizations, tweaks and idealy dotfiles for easy import/accessibility across my devices and implementations.

## Ubuntu/Kbuntu-specific
My current work environment is [kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/) on a Dell Precision 5200.

## Kali-specific
I have a 'pentesting' VM with Kali installed for started.  May eventually migrate to base vanilla Ubuntu with custom tooling installed as I get better at things, but until then, this will be the setup.
